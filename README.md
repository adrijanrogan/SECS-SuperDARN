# SECS-SuperDARN

SECS-SuerDARN is a Python program that computes a divergence-free ion dirt vector field based on line-of-sight SuperDARN velocities.  The work is
sponsored by a NASA contract 80GSFC22CA011.

The program currently reads SuperDARN files available from the JHUAPL website https://superdarn.jhuapl.edu/. Best results are obtained from the "V3_grid" 
data format which removed most of the clutter.

The program is under development as we speak.

Install the program in a development mode as
```
python setup.py develop
```
